        [Intro]
        (Hold me close) Look me dead in my eyes
        (Dead in my) 'Til the day that I die
        (Dead inside) I just wanna feel alive
        (With you, I'm alive) With you, I'm alive
        Fell in love, but it left me lonely
        Tried to trust, but it burned me slowly
        I didn't know what I was looking for
        
        [Chorus]
        'Til I found her
        I found her
        Without her
        I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
        There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
        'Til I found her (Oh, oh)
        
        [Verse]
        I've run for many miles trying to find love
        From a woman that could love me and nevеr leave my side
        And I'vе run for many miles trying to get away from
        The things I'm afraid of and everything inside
        You say that we're already done (Done)
        But what does that even mean?
        You tell me to open my eyes
        Thank God it was just a dream
        I guess that's how you know that it's love
        When you're scared to death they'll leave
        Just say that you'll never leave, never leave

        [Bridge]
        (Baby, hold me close) Look me dead in my eyes
        (Dead in my) 'Til the day that I die
        (Dead inside) I just wanna feel alive
        (With you, I'm alive) With you, I'm a—, uh
        Fell in love, but it left me lonely
        Tried to trust, but it burned me slowly
        I didn't know what I was looking for
        
        [Chorus]
        'Til I found her
        I found her
        Without her
        I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
        There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
        'Til I found her (Oh, oh)
        Without her
        I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
        There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
        'Til I found her (Oh, oh)
        
        [Outro]
        'Til I found her
        Ooh-ooh-ooh
